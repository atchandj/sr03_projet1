# Trombinoscope

In the context of the laboratories of the course Programming Internet application (SR03) taught at Université de Technologie de Compiègne, we have developed 3 web applications. The application in this repository is the first one: a trombinoscope in the form of a dynamic website. We had to use a web service and display the results. 

Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery and PHP.
